# EndToEnd Tests for kubic-init

Currently under dev. for beta-version

# Motivation:

This tests will reflect the e2e tests framework from kubernetes upstream.

For more info take a look:
`https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/test`

# Goals:

The goal of `e2e` kubic tests are:
 - be in sync with kubernetes upstream (design, framework, etc)
 - containing some tests specific for `kubic-init`.
 - develop tests for kubic-init  and upstream as possible.

# Roadmap:

- research how to integrate with upstream and copy it structure/design as possible with simplicity for custom tests
- Create minimal skeleton of project reflecting kubernetes.
- Having first tests like checking the services.
